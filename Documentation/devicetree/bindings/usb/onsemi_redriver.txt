ON Semiconductor USB Type-C and display port 10Gbps Linear Re-Driver

Required properties:
- compatible: Must be "onnn,redriver".
- reg: I2C address on the selected bus.
- extcon: phandles to external connector devices. The first phandle
	should point to the external connector which provides
	both "USB" cable events and "USB-HOST" cable events.
	An optional second phandle may be specified for DP
	lane events.

Optional properties:
- eq: Equalization value of re-driver channel A/B/C/D, 8 bit.
- flat-gain: Flat gain control value of re-driver channel A/B/C/D, 8 bit.
- output-comp: Output compression value of re-driver channel A/B/C/D,
	8 bit.
- loss-match: Loss profile matching control value of re-driver channel
	A/B/C/D, 8 bit.

Example:
	redriver@19 {
		compatible = "onnn,redriver";
		reg = <0x19>;
		extcon = <&pm8150b_pdphy>, <&pm8150b_pdphy>;
		eq = /bits/ 8 <0x5 0x4 0x4 0x5>;
		flat-gain = /bits/ 8 <0x3 0x1 0x1 0x3>;
		output-comp = /bits/ 8 <0x2 0x2 0x2 0x2>;
		loss-match = /bits/ 8 <0x0 0x3 0x3 0x0>;
	};
